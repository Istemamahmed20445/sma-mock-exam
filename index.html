                question: "A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department with severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever (38.9°C), and localized tenderness. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen confirms a diagnosis of acute diverticulitis complicated by a diverticular abscess. The specific size of the abscess is not explicitly mentioned in the initial report, but it is larger than what would typically resolve with antibiotics alone. What is the most appropriate immediate management strategy for this patient, given the presence of a diverticular abscess?",
                options: [
                    { text: "Initiate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and observe closely for 72 hours.", isCorrect: false },
                    { text: "Prepare for an urgent Hartmann's procedure (sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy).", isCorrect: false },
                    { text: "Arrange for image-guided percutaneous drainage of the abscess.", isCorrect: true },
                    { text: "Commence a clear fluid diet and oral antibiotics.", isCorrect: false },

                explanation: "For diverticular abscesses, especially those larger than 2-3 cm (implied by 'larger than what would typically resolve with antibiotics alone'), percutaneous CT-guided drainage is the preferred initial management if feasible. This minimally invasive procedure aims to drain the infected fluid, resolve the acute infection, and can often avert immediate surgery. Sigmoidectomy or Hartmann's procedure is typically reserved for cases where percutaneous drainage fails, for recurrent disease, or for more severe complications like free perforation or generalized peritonitis."

                question: "A 28-year-old female patient, who has a documented history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), confides in you during her consultation that she has been experiencing frequent suicidal thoughts. However, she explicitly states that she has no concrete plan, no intent to act on these thoughts, and she denies any access to means. She expresses a desire for help and agrees to engage in treatment. What is the most appropriate initial management approach for this patient?",
                options: [
                    { text: "Immediately admit her to an inpatient psychiatric unit for acute stabilization.", isCorrect: false },

                ],
                explanation: "For patients with suicidal ideation who deny a specific plan, intent, or access to means, and who are willing to cooperate with safety planning, outpatient management is often appropriate and preferred over automatic inpatient admission. A detailed safety plan (identifying triggers, coping strategies, and crisis contacts), coupled with close follow-up and optimization of her antidepressant regimen, is crucial. This approach balances patient safety with maintaining autonomy and community-based care."

                question: "A 40-year-old male patient, recently commenced on a new antipsychotic medication for his psychiatric condition, presents with an acute onset of severe subjective restlessness. He describes an overwhelming urge to move, particularly his legs, and an inability to sit still. He constantly paces the room and shifts positions. This distressing side effect is most consistent with akathisia. What is the most appropriate initial pharmacological intervention to manage this extrapyramidal symptom?",
                options: [
                    { text: "Increase the dose of the current antipsychotic medication.", isCorrect: false },

                    { text: "Administer an anticholinergic medication like benztropine.", isCorrect: false }
                ],
                explanation: "Akathisia, characterized by motor restlessness and inner tension, is a common extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotics. Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol) are generally considered first-line pharmacological agents for managing akathisia. They help reduce the motor symptoms and subjective distress. Anticholinergics are more effective for acute dystonia and drug-induced parkinsonism, but less so for akathisia."

                question: "A 65-year-old patient with a long history of chronic schizophrenia, who has been on various antipsychotic medications for many years, presents with a new onset of involuntary, repetitive, purposeless movements. These movements predominantly affect his face, manifesting as lip-smacking, tongue protrusion, and grimacing. Occasionally, he also exhibits repetitive finger movements. This constellation of symptoms is characteristic of tardive dyskinesia. What is the most appropriate general treatment approach for this condition?",
                options: [
                    { text: "Increase the dose of the current antipsychotic medication to suppress movements.", isCorrect: false },

                ],
                explanation: "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a chronic, often irreversible movement disorder caused by long-term antipsychotic use. The primary management involves reducing or, if possible, discontinuing the offending antipsychotic or switching to an atypical antipsychotic with a lower TD risk. Newer medications, particularly VMAT2 inhibitors (e.g., deutetrabenazine, valbenazine), are specifically approved for the treatment of TD and are effective in reducing the involuntary movements. Benzodiazepines and anticholinergics are generally not effective for TD and can sometimes worsen it."

            {
                question: "A 22-year-old male, within hours of receiving his first dose of a typical antipsychotic medication, develops sudden, painful, sustained muscle contractions. He presents with severe neck twisting (torticollis), involuntary upward deviation of his eyes (oculogyric crisis), and difficulty speaking due to muscle spasms in his jaw. This acute reaction is consistent with acute dystonia. What is the most appropriate and rapidly effective pharmacological intervention for this condition?",
                options: [

                ],
                explanation: "Acute dystonia is a painful, involuntary muscle contraction typically occurring early in antipsychotic treatment. It is considered an emergency. Anticholinergic medications, such as benztropine or procyclidine, administered intravenously or intramuscularly, are highly effective and rapidly reverse the dystonic reaction. Benzodiazepines can provide some muscle relaxation but are not first-line for acute dystonia."

                question: "A 45-year-old farmer presents with a two-month history of undulating fever, profuse sweating (especially at night), migratory arthralgia, and significant fatigue. He also reports consuming unpasteurized milk from his herd and having direct contact with his cattle. Laboratory tests show mild pancytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. Serological testing is pending but a diagnosis of brucellosis is highly suspected. What is the most appropriate initial combination antibiotic regimen for suspected or confirmed brucellosis in an adult?",
                options: [

                    { text: "Penicillin G and Gentamicin.", isCorrect: false }
                ],
                explanation: "Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection commonly acquired from infected animals or unpasteurized dairy products. Due to its intracellular nature and propensity for relapse, combination therapy is essential. The standard and most effective initial antibiotic regimen for brucellosis in adults is a prolonged course of oral Doxycycline combined with Rifampicin. This combination offers synergistic activity and helps prevent relapses."

                question: "A 50-year-old male, who works in a rural abattoir and has a history of recreational hunting, presents with a several-week history of severe headache, fever (up to 39°C), profound malaise, and myalgia. He denies any rash. Liver function tests show elevated transaminases. Based on his occupational and recreational exposures, Q fever is suspected. What is the recommended first-line antibiotic treatment for acute Q fever?",

                ],
                explanation: "Q fever, caused by *Coxiella burnitii*, is a zoonotic infection commonly associated with exposure to livestock. Doxycycline is the cornerstone of treatment for acute Q fever and is highly effective in resolving symptoms and preventing chronic disease. A prolonged course is typically required. While other antibiotics might have some activity, Doxycycline is the first-line recommended agent."

He presents with high fever, a non-productive cough, profound confusion, and significant hyponatremia (serum sodium 125 mmol/L). A urinary antigen test for *Legionella pneumophila* is positive. What is the most appropriate first-line antibiotic treatment for this severe *Legionella* pneumonia?",

                ],
                explanation: "*Legionella pneumophila* is an atypical bacterium that often causes severe pneumonia, particularly in older adults and those with comorbidities like COPD, and can be associated with extrapulmonary symptoms like confusion and hyponatremia. Macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) and fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are the recommended first-line treatments for Legionella pneumonia due to their excellent intracellular penetration and efficacy against this pathogen."

A comprehensive cardiotocograph (CTG) is performed and is definitively interpreted as reassuring, showing a normal baseline fetal heart rate, good variability, and no decelerations. On vaginal examination, her cervix is found to be 2 cm dilated and 50% effaced, with the presenting part at -2 station. Given these findings, what is the most appropriate immediate management plan for this patient?",
                options: [

                ],
                explanation: "While a reassuring CTG following decreased fetal movements (DFM) generally indicates fetal well-being, DFM at term (40 weeks) is a significant concern that warrants careful consideration. Given that the patient is already 2 cm dilated and 50% effaced, her cervix is favourable for induction. In such a scenario, where the patient is at term and has a favorable cervix, and has presented with DFM (even if CTG is currently reassuring), proceeding to induction of labour is a common and appropriate strategy to expedite delivery and prevent potential adverse outcomes. Discharge home, while possible with a truly normal CTG, is less preferred given the term gestation and initial DFM complaint, and the cervical findings suggest she is already progressing."

A lumbar puncture is performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis (elevated white blood cells, predominantly lymphocytes), normal CSF glucose, and mildly elevated CSF protein. Gram stain and bacterial cultures of the CSF are negative. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of viral meningitis is made. What is the most appropriate management approach for this patient?",

                explanation: "Viral meningitis is typically a self-limiting condition, and in immunocompetent individuals, it rarely causes serious complications. The CSF findings (lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose, negative bacterial cultures) are classic for viral meningitis. Therefore, the mainstay of management is symptomatic and supportive care, which includes pain relief (analgesia for headache), antiemetics for nausea/vomiting, and ensuring adequate hydration. Antibiotics are unnecessary as the cause is viral, and antivirals are only indicated if a specific treatable viral etiology (e.g., HSV) is suspected, which is not implied here."

                question: "A 35-year-old bushwalker presents to the emergency department approximately 30 minutes after sustaining a suspected snake bite to his ankle. He reports no immediate pain, swelling, or systemic symptoms. At the 2-hour mark post-bite, he remains asymptomatic with no local signs of envenomation. Despite the absence of clinical signs, Australian snake bites can cause delayed systemic effects.

Therefore, a full coagulation profile at regular intervals (e.g., 1-2 hourly for 6-12 hours in an asymptomatic bite) is the most crucial initial investigation to detect occult envenomation and guide the need for antivenom, even in the absence of clinical signs.

This involves evaluating their ability to understand the information, appreciate the consequences, reason, and communicate a choice.
